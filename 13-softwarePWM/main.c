/*
 This example requires an external LED (and suitable current-limiting resistor) on P1.6

 This example generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output to drive an external LED.
 PWM is a way to drive a component at less than 100% intensity using only high or low values by
 rapidly turning the component on and off. If done fast enough this is invisible to the user.
 In this example we use it to drive an LED at varying intensities.
 The ratio of time spent on to off is called the 'duty cycle'

 An almost-100% duty cycle PWM signal might look like:
 |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|__

 A 50% duty cycle PWM signal:
 |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|____________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|____________________

 An almost 0% PWM signal:
 |‾‾|______________________________________|‾‾|______________________________________

 In this example we show how to implement this manually in software.

 In order to implement PWM control, we need two set points - one denotes the maximum PWM point,
 and another denotes the toggle point at which the output will change. By changing this second set point
 at runtime we can control how much of the time the output spends high vs low.

                                      v--------- PWM toggle point
                                             v-- PWM period
 Values: |----------------------------T------|-----------------------------T------|
 Output: _____________________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾|_____________________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾|

 In the code below PWM_PERIOD is the, well, PWM period. In the main loop `onTime` is the toggle point.
